# Bladee Discography Database

Bladee Discography Database is a web application that allows users to explore the discography of the Swedish artist Bladee. The application provides information about albums, tracklists, genres, release dates, and user reviews.

## Description

Bladee is a Swedish artist, known for his involvement in the music group Drain Gang. This web app was created to serve as a comprehensive database for Bladee's solo music, enabling users to view album details and reviews. Users can read existing reviews or create, edit, and delete their own reviews.

## Deployed Copy

After many, many attempts and creating a Github personal token, I wasn't able to deploy my copy to the i6 server. I was, however, able to run this locally... Unfortunately with my work schedule (and then catching a virus going around from my job), the tutoring session times did not work for me, and I was not able to resolve this.

## Collaborators

I worked on this by myself.
